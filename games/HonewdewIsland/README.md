**Team Member:** Raghavendra Thakur

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
[example format: "It's like Stardew Valley meets Tiny Kingdom meets Minecraft Skyblock but with levels, biomes, and dimensions" (doesn't have to follow this format)]

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
There will be adventure aspects, unlike other farming games. There will also be structures

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Honewdew Island is a slow paced farming game. You start off in an island in an ocean and you collect crops, build up reputation, and unlock new islands, biomes, and dimensions. The players' goal is to unlock new crops and levels and build money and reputation.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The game will be relaxing and keep players engaged by the calm game play and the eventual adventure.
